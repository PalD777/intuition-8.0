<h2><b> Introduction to taxes</b> </h2>
Governments can get money in various ways. 
For example, they can charge fees for such things as driver’s licenses. 
But almost every government gets money simply by demanding a certain amount from its citizens. 
This money is called a tax.

<h2><b> Purpose of taxes</b> </h2>
Governments collect taxes for several purposes. 
The most important purpose is to get money to pay for government services. 
These services include protection by an army or police, road building, and public education. 
Some governments use taxes to change people’s behavior. 
For example, they may put high taxes on tobacco to get people to stop smoking. 
Finally, governments may raise or lower taxes to help their country’s overall economy.

<h2><b> Types of taxes</b> </h2>
There are many different types of taxes. 
Among them are income taxes, property taxes, and sales taxes.

A tax on the money that people make is called a personal income tax. 
Companies in the United States withhold, or hold back, a part of almost every worker’s pay. 
They send this money to the U.S. government. 
After the end of the year, people send in income tax returns, which are forms that tell the government how much money they made.
Some people then have to pay still more money, while others get back some of their money in a refund. 
Sometimes governments make rich people pay higher taxes than poor people. 
Companies also pay taxes on the money they make. This tax is called corporate income tax.

Taxes on the value of land, buildings, and some large possessions (cars, for example) are called property taxes. In the United States, state and local governments collect property taxes.
When people buy goods and services, they often pay a sales tax on top of the price. Sales tax is usually a certain percentage of the selling price. In the United States, each state has its own sales taxes. However, many countries have national sales taxes. European countries use a form of sales tax called a value-added tax (VAT).
