<h2><b> Buying Power </b></h2>

Buying power, also referred to as excess equity, is the money an investor has available to buy securities in a trading context. Buying power equals the total cash held in the brokerage account plus all available margin.

Buying power is referred to as a margin account, as traders take out a loan based on the amount of cash held in their brokerage account. Regulation T, established by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), mandates that an investor’s initial margin requirement in this account type must be at least 50%, meaning the trader has two times buying power.

<b> Buying Power of Margin Accounts</b>
The amount of margin a brokerage firm can offer a particular customer depends on the firm's risk parameters and the customer. Typically, equity margin accounts offer investors twice as much as the cash held in the account, although some forex broker margin accounts offer buying power of up to 50:1.

<b> Buying Power of Day Trading Accounts</b>
Pattern day trading accounts work differently to regular margin accounts in that they require a minimum equity requirement of $25,000, as opposed to $2,000. While a trader has to finance 50% of their stock positions in a standard margin account - which provides two times equity in buying power, they only have to fund 25% of the cost of securities purchased in a pattern day trading account – giving the trader four times equity buying power.
