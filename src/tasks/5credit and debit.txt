<h2> Intro to Debit and Credit </h2>

<b>Debit</b> - A debit is an accounting entry that either increases an asset or expense account, or decreases a liability or equity account. It is positioned to the left in an accounting entry.

<b>Credit</b> - A credit is an accounting entry that either increases a liability or equity account, or decreases an asset or expense account. It is positioned to the right in an accounting entry.

<h2>Debit and Credit Usage</h2>
Whenever an accounting transaction is created, at least two accounts are always impacted, with a debit entry being recorded against one account and a credit entry being recorded against the other account. 
There is no upper limit to the number of accounts involved in a transaction - but the minimum is no less than two accounts. 
The totals of the debits and credits for any transaction must always equal each other, so that an accounting transaction is always said to be "in balance." 
If a transaction were not in balance, then it would not be possible to create financial statements. 
Thus, the use of debits and credits in a two-column transaction recording format is the most essential of all controls over accounting accuracy.

Debits and credits have different impacts across several broad types of accounts, which are:
    <b>Asset accounts</b> - A debit increases the balance and a credit decreases the balance.
    <b>Liability accounts</b> - A debit decreases the balance and a credit increases the balance.
    <b>Equity accounts</b> - A debit decreases the balance and a credit increases the balance.
